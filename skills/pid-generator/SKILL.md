# P&ID Generator

Produce a conceptual P&ID as a hand-authored SVG that a process engineer would accept: correct process flow, correct ISA instrumentation, closed control loops, and a layout with zero collisions and zero crossed process lines.

The output is judged by an engineer who will spot a backwards arrowhead, a steam coil above the liquid level, or a label sitting under a balloon. Accuracy and legibility rank above speed.

### Non-negotiable output rules

1. **No hidden text.** Every label must be fully readable. Nothing may sit under a line, balloon, valve, vessel, or another label.
2. **No crossing process lines.** Solve crossings by re-planning elevations, not by drawing over. If one is truly unavoidable, draw a proper line jump (semicircular hop).
3. **Control loops must be complete and directional.** Every loop is measurement → controller → final element, with an arrowhead on each leg. A signal line without an arrowhead is a defect.
4. **Text is real `<text>`, never glyph paths or outlines.** The user must be able to edit labels in a text editor. Never emit a matplotlib/Illustrator-style SVG where letters are `<use>` or `<path>` references.
5. **Minimum font size 8.5.** Tag text 10–11.5, line labels 11–13, title 20–22. Nothing smaller than 8.5 survives a slide deck.
6. **Elevations must be physically true.** See Rule of elevation below.

### Workflow

#### 1. Read the description and fill the gaps

A process description almost always underspecifies the drawing. Before drawing, resolve:

- What is the controlled variable, and what is the final control element?
- Are any loops cascaded? Which is master, which is slave?
- Where does each stream enter and leave the vessel (top, bottom, side; above or below liquid level)?
- What is the heating/cooling medium and its return path?
- Any redundant or voting instruments?

Ask at most 2–3 questions, and only for things that change the drawing. For anything minor, make a defensible engineering assumption and state it in the response afterward. Do not stall the drawing over detail that can be noted as an assumption.

#### 2. Plan the layout on paper before writing any SVG

Write out the coordinate plan first. This step is what prevents rework.

- Choose a canvas. Default `1400 × 940`, landscape, with a hairline border inset 20.
- Place the main vessel/equipment roughly centered, e.g. `x 560–800, y 300–640`.
- Assign each horizontal run its own **elevation band** (a y value), and each vertical run its own **corridor** (an x value). Two lines sharing a band or corridor is how crossings happen.
- List every label with its anchor point and estimated width, and check it against the bounding box of every nearby symbol. Estimate text width as `0.55 × font_size × character_count` for regular and `0.6 ×` for bold. This is approximate — the render check in step 4 is the real verification.

**Rule of elevation.** Lay out by physics first, then aesthetics:
- Gravity drains and bottoms products leave the bottom head.
- A submerged coil or sparger enters *below* normal liquid level.
- A free-fall or splash-fill inlet enters *above* level, usually through a top nozzle.
- Vents, relief, and vapor lines leave the top.
- Nozzles land on flat wall sections, never on a corner radius.
- If two supply lines both come from the left, put the one that connects lower on the vessel at a lower elevation the whole way. That alone removes most crossings.

#### 3. Generate the SVG from a parametric script

Write a Python script that emits the SVG. Never hand-type raw SVG for a full drawing.

Every drawing goes through at least three revisions. A script with named coordinates makes "shift the steam header down 40" a one-line change; hand-typed SVG makes it a rewrite.

Emit in this order: vessel bodies and fills, external pipes, vessel internals (coils, dip pipes), equipment details, then balloons and valves last with white fill. Internals drawn before the vessel fill get painted over; balloons drawn before pipes get a line through the tag.

`scripts/pid_lib.py` provides the primitives: `bubble`, `cvalve`, `pipe`, `sig`, `vessel`, `agitator`, `steam_trap`, `line_jump`, `legend`, `txt`. Read that file before writing the script and use it rather than reinventing symbols. Read `references/isa-conventions.md` for symbol and tag rules, and `references/layout-rules.md` for the collision geometry.

#### 4. Render, look at it, and fix — then repeat

**This step is mandatory and is the difference between a passable drawing and a professional one.** Do not deliver a P&ID you have not looked at.

This step needs `cairosvg` and `pillow` (see `scripts/requirements.txt`). Install them once before the first render rather than discovering the gap mid-loop.

```bash
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt -q   # add --break-system-packages on a managed Python
python3 build_pid.py
python3 -c "import cairosvg; cairosvg.svg2png(url='out.svg', write_to='preview.png', output_width=1680)"
```

Then open `preview.png` as an image (the Read tool in Claude Code, the `view` tool on claude.ai) and inspect it as an engineer would. Also crop and zoom the dense areas (control clusters, the vessel interior, instrument stacks) at 3200 px wide — collisions of a few pixels are invisible at full-sheet scale:

```python
from PIL import Image
im = Image.open('z.png'); sx = 3200/1400
im.crop((int(x0*sx), int(y0*sx), int(x1*sx), int(y1*sx))).save('zoom.png')
```

Run the checklist in `references/layout-rules.md` against what you see. Fix and re-render until it passes. Expect 2–4 rounds. Common defects caught only by looking:
- A symbol drawn from bad coordinates (two triangles merging into one blob)
- A label overlapping the first balloon on its line
- An arrowhead landing on the wrong side of a symbol
- Two collinear signal segments reading as one continuous line
- A label that fits at font 11 but collides after the user bumps it to 13

#### 5. Deliver

Save the SVG where the user can reach it and present it: use the path they asked for, otherwise the current working directory — or `/mnt/user-data/outputs/` when that directory exists (claude.ai). Keep the generator script alongside it, and mention it exists — the user will want revisions.

In the response, state briefly:
- Engineering assumptions made
- Anything in the description that could not be drawn and why
- Any design concern noticed while drawing (e.g. free-fall entry will entrain air; a bottom outlet with no isolation valve). Flagging these is a large part of the value.

### Instrumentation, condensed

Full detail in `references/isa-conventions.md`. The rules that matter most:

- **Balloon type encodes location.** Plain circle = field mounted. Circle inside a square = DCS / shared display. Getting this wrong makes controllers look like local gauges.
- **Tag = function letters + loop number.** First letter is the measured variable (F, L, P, T, A), following letters the function (I indicator, C controller, T transmitter, V valve). Every element of one loop shares a loop number: `TIC-101`, `TI-101`, `TV-101`.
- **Signal lines are dashed, process lines are solid and heavier.** Distinguish by weight and dash, and put both in the legend.
- **Arrow direction is semantic.** Into the controller = measurement. Out of the controller = output. A cascade master's output arrows into the slave controller and is labeled as a remote setpoint.
- **Show valve failure position** (FC, FO, FL) next to each control valve tag. It is one of the first things a reviewer looks for.
- Controllers can carry one short tuning or action note (e.g. "direct acting"), placed in dead space, never on a line.

### Sheet furniture

Include unless the user says otherwise:

- Title and one-line subtitle naming the service and the control scheme
- `NOT FOR CONSTRUCTION` stamp in red outline, top right — mandatory on any conceptual drawing
- Legend covering exactly the line types used, and no others
- Design basis note (duty, flows, residence time, valve position at design) — this is what makes the drawing defensible in a review
- Revision identifier

Also state, in the drawing or the response, what a conceptual P&ID deliberately omits: relief devices, isolation and drain valves, vents, line numbers, insulation and tracing, and equipment sizing. Without that note a reader may assume the scope is complete.

### Style

Restrained engineering palette, not a marketing graphic. Working defaults:

| Element | Color | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| Process liquid | `#1d4e89` | 2.4 |
| Steam / condensate | `#a34a28` | 2.4 |
| Instrument signal | `#50565f` | 1.35, dash `7,5.5` |
| Equipment outline | `#343a46` | 1.6–2.2 |
| Body text | `#111418` | — |
| Secondary text | `#5a6472` | — |
| Vessel shell / liquid | `#f7f8fa` / `#dce8f5` | — |
| NOT FOR CONSTRUCTION | `#b02418` | 1.4 |

Add one color per additional service (cooling water, nitrogen, product) and put each in the legend. Balloons and valves get white fill so process lines do not show through them.

### What this skill does not do

It draws conceptual P&IDs. It is not a substitute for an issued-for-design P&ID, does not size equipment or relief devices, and does not perform hazard analysis. Say so if the user's framing suggests they expect otherwise.
